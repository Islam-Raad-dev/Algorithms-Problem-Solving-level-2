# 📘 Algorithms & Problem-Solving – Level 2

Welcome to my repository for **Level 2** of the Algorithms & Problem-Solving series. This course is a pivotal bridge in my journey from understanding syntax to building real-world programming experience.

## 🚀 Overview
This is the 5th course in my programming roadmap. After mastering the foundations in Level 1 and learning to write Clean Code using "Divide and Conquer," I am now focusing on applying those principles to more complex challenges.

### 🧠 The Methodology
My approach in this repository follows the **Attempt → Fail → Learn → Improve** cycle:
1.  **Independent Attempt:** Trying to solve each problem from scratch.
2.  **Reflection:** Comparing my logic with professional solutions.
3.  **Refinement:** Re-writing the code to meet professional clean code standards.

---

## 📖 What I’m Learning
* **Complex Logic:** Tackling 50 new, intermediate-level algorithmic problems.
* **Pattern Recognition:** Identifying common algorithmic patterns across different problems.
* **Clean Code under Pressure:** Maintaining high-quality code even as the logic gets harder.
* **Project Thinking:** Transitioning from solving isolated problems to building complete projects.
* **Divide & Conquer:** Breaking down complex requirements into small, manageable functions.

## 🧱 Repository Structure
The repository is organized into two main sections:

### 1. The 50 Problem Challenge
A collection of 50 algorithmic problems designed to stretch logical thinking.
* *Topics covered:* Arrays, Strings, Loops, Math Logic, and Data Manipulation.

### 2. Real-World Projects
At the end of this course, I will be implementing two comprehensive projects:
* **Project 1:** [Pending completion]
* **Project 2:** [Pending completion]

## 🛠 Technologies Used
* **Language:** C++
* **Principles:** Clean Code, Divide & Conquer, Algorithmic Optimization.
* **Environment:** GitHub Codespaces / VS Code.

## 🎓 Certification Goal
By completing this level, I aim to verify my ability to:
- Solve intermediate algorithmic problems.
- Transition from problem solving to project development.
- Prepare for advanced programming and Artificial Intelligence challenges.
